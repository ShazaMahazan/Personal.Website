			<h2>My Family</h2>
			<h3>A family is one of the greatest gift to all living creatures on the earth.</h3>
			<p>Family is defined as the collective body of persons living in one house under one head. Mostly a family comprises of husband and wife and their children.</p>
			<p>Family is always a number one priority in my life. They are my first school and their teaching has strengthened my bond with them and their love makes me feel good always.</p>
            <p>Growing under the supervision of a caring and loving family will increase my social values and overall well-being. Each member of my family carries out equal responsibility in sculpting the strong bonding needed for a better future and developing moral importance in each other.</p>
            <p>A family becomes the first school for children where they learn all the culture, traditions and most essential basic family values. The family plays a key role in teaching children good behavior and habits in the family. It helps in creating a better character person in society. I am really fortunate enough to be born into a small dear family where I learn everything in my childhood.</p>
            <p>Just like a few of our basic requirements to live life. A human being also requires several other emotional needs like love, which is essential for mental happiness. Families are important because they give us unlimited love, laughter, and a feeling of belonging.</p>
