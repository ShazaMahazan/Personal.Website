  	<p>The Information Management course is an educational program offered at UiTM that strives to address the demands of information and knowledge workers who play a significant role in the information industry. Graduates are educated to gain knowledge on information literacy, information handling, information communication and technological applications in order to accomplish vision 2020. This programme or course is not widely known, and many people do not believe it will be a significant field in the future. This is because some critics claimed that it merely prepares students to be clerks who manage information. In general, students will learn about information agencies such as archives, libraries, information centres, and record centres through information management courses.</p>

  	<p>The Information Management course has nothing to do with calculations or mathematics instead, this course is more concerned with facts and theory. I studied the subject "Introduction to information management" for subject code IMD112 during the first semester. I was introduced to the definition of information, as well as the life cycle of information, which is the management of information from its creation until its disposal. There are several resources accessible for obtaining information, and it must fit certain criteria in order for the information to be accurate and valuable. However, people should exercise caution when interpreting information, as this can lead to information overload and information explosion. I began to study information agencies in terms of roles, functions, and even organizational objectives. This subject was simple to grasp and piqued my interest in learning more about information management programs. Moreover, during the first semester, I was exposed to “citations” in the subject of introduction to information skills, IMD111. I was introduced to various types of citations and their uses as references. This is very useful because I will apply it in every assignment received from the beginning of the semester until now. </p>

  	<p>Following that, for the second semester, I took the subject code IMD124, which is "Access to Information." This topic is mostly concerned with the methods or instruments used to acquire or obtain information from diverse sources, such as bibliographic control. I learned about bibliographic utilities and important bibliographic utility services that share the same goals as MalMARC, SILAS, OCLC, RLIN, AGRIS, and INIS in this subject. While debris cataloging, online union catalog, procurement work, and online information are their five most common services. This is a one-of-a-kind subject for me because it is related to libraries, and it is new to me.</p>

  	<p>In semester 3, IMD213 is one of the subject codes provided, basically, this subject is organization of information. The thing I learned in this subject was, in organizing information and knowledge, professional duties include representation various types of organizational information either in developing methods and systems structuring and accessing information, distribution, and delivery of information, strengthening the use and value of information, the storage and retrieval of information and more. I learned and knew that the correct cataloging, classification, arrangement of information materials is the most necessary activities that should be implemented. It also explains that standardization is a common but important element that students should understand who have studied this subject as well as by information professionals. In this subject, I have studied the most widely discussed elements of library organization compared to other information agencies. Information organization is focused on improving accessibility and quality of information so that information agencies will have a view of self -enlightenment and its surroundings</p>
  	
  	<p>To conclude, each subject studied in this course has particular importance and privilege. Through the information management course many new things I can learn and its application in the future. Through this course, I was able to learn various skills to be able to access accurate information. This course has facilitated my affairs in finding information and in turn, gave me a new understanding of the field of information professionals. </p>
